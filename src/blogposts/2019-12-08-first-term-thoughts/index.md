First term of the second year is finally over, and with that comes a great relief - no more stressing about assignments and deadlines, many of which I have completely neglected this term and started the day before they were due..

The first few months of the new academic year also presented some challenges. New modules like C++ and Objected Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) were a bit of a hassle. Even though I had C++ experience prior to starting this term, lack of practice and slight laziness meant I had to revise more than I would have wanted to. Delays on the OOAD coursework were mostly caused by lack of interest in lecture material, but as uninteresting as it was, it had to be done. One lesson learnt from that is to never start working on a massive assignment the day before it's due :)

On the bright side, I managed to do a lot of projects not related to the University in my spare time. I spent a lot of time in the last months honing my React and JavaScript skills to put together this website, as well as a website for my girlfriend's portfolio. I also learnt the Swift language and made an actual [iOS app](https://github.com/PiotrRut/iOS-Stopwatch-App)!

Lastly, I would like to thank [Amelia](https://amelia-panella.netlify.com), [Josh](https://joshboddy.com), [Reece](http://reecemercer.dev), [Gawtam](https://www.instagram.com/gawtamt/) and [Beatriz](https://twitter.com/mbeatrizrsl) for keeping me sane through all this, helping whenever help was needed, and making my uni experience a fun one!
