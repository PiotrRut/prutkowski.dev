With the second term of this year finished _way_ sooner than expected, there is __a lot__ to talk about..

Towards the end of January the long dreaded group project started. This straight away long hours, meeting your group
from time to time, and otherwise trying to juggle this massive 30-credit module with other modules and courseworks. Thanks
to my group and my unbelievably high motivation this term, we managed to deliver the forst module deliverable, a _system design specification_ on time, and even managed to get a pretty decent grade for it.

The second stage of the project - the implementation, however, was not that easy. We soon found ourselves in a very sticky situation, where I had very little (I mean none) help from other team mates, and had to create the whole system entirely on my own. It is by the way public on GitHub now, and you can see it [here](https://github.com/PiotrRut/ATSFrontend).

Then came the industrial action, which lasted the majority of March, and resulted in many cancelled lectures. Fortunately, our
lecturers were kind enough to offer extensions up to 2 weeks, as well as made changes to weighting, which put at least my mind at ease.

__And then__, as if the industrial action wasn't enough, the COVID-19 pandemic wave came to the UK, resulting in a mass lockdown, with restaurants, malls, stores, and most importantly schools - closing. Needless to say, yet another wave of extensions and cancelled assesments came up on us, but I don't think I'm gonna complain about that too much... ðŸ˜‰
