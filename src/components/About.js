            Great question! My name is Piotr, although people mostly call me Peter, and I am a {age} year old programmer
            and second-year BSc Computer Science student at City, University of London.
            I was originally born in Poland, but for the majority
            of my life I&#39;ve been living in Norway. In September 2018 I moved to London to study.
            Before I came to the UK I graduated high school with a diploma in general studies,
            as well as electronics and electrical engineering.

            In my free time, apart from working on various programming projects, I dedicate a lot of time to photography.
            I&#39;ve been taking pictures since I can remember, and the website you&#39;re currently on, doubles as my
            photographic portfolio.
            <br />
            In the <Link to="/photogallery">gallery</Link> section, you can view some of my shots and download them!

            My passion for programming started a couple of years ago, after
            accidentally finding a Python instruction course on YouTube. Ever
            since I have been trying to learn new languages, concepts, and
            technologies. What amazes me most about computer science, is how
            vast it is, and just how much you can do with even a slight
            knowledge of it. I am learning more and more every single day, both in University
            and in my spare time, through various side-projects.
