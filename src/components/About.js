            Great question! My name is Piotr, although people mostly call me Peter, and I am a {age} year old programmer
            and second-year BSc Computer Science student at City, University of London.
            I was originally born in Poland, but for the majority
            of my life I&#39;ve been living in Norway. In September 2018 I moved to London to study.
            Before I came to the UK I graduated high school with a diploma in general studies,
            as well as electronics and electrical engineering. I am currently working as an intern software engineer for <a href="http://equalsmoney.com">Equals</a>!

            In my free time, apart from working on various programming projects, I dedicate a lot of time to photography.
            I&#39;ve been taking pictures since I can remember, and the website you&#39;re currently on, doubles as my
            photographic portfolio.
            In the <Link to="/photogallery">gallery</Link> section, you can view some of my shots and download them!
