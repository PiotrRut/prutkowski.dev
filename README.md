My old personal website, which I made back in 2019, was well overdue for a redesign. I therefore finally decided to sit down and do it, and that is exactly how this website was created. 

It is written entirely from scratch using React and Gatsby. It is mostly a single page web app, with the few exceptions of my blog, projects' list and the photography portfolio being on separate pages.
