My old personal website, which I made back in 2019, was well overdue for a redesign. I therefore finally decided to sit down and do it, and that is exactly how this website was created. 

It is written entirely from scratch using React with hooks and Gatsby. It is mostly a single page web app, with a few exceptions:

* __Projects__: This page holds a list of all my public GitHub repositories, automatically updated via the GitHub API
* __Blog__: Hold a list of all my blog posts, written in markdown.
* __Gallery__: Displays a chosen selection of photographs I've recently taken. It retrieves the pictures through a remote Heroku dyno from my Microsoft Azure storage.

## :open_file_folder: Frameworks and libraries used

* Material UI
* TailwindCSS
* Wow.js
